# Example VEXcode Pro V5 Projects

In this repository will be multiple example projects.  Each project will attempt to show how to use a different aspect of code, from how to set a motor selectors to feedback controllers and autonomous selectors.  

## Downloading VEXcode
All of these projects will be in C++ using VEXcode Pro V5.  [Download that here](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode-download), scroll down and find VEXcode Pro V5.  Download and run the installer.  

## How to Download Projects
[You can download all of these projects here](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/VEXcode-Tutorials/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). 

## Opening the Projects
After extracting the zip, in VEXcode, go to `File` -> `Open` and navigate to your `Downloads` to find the `Example` folder.  Open this, and find the example project you are looking for.
