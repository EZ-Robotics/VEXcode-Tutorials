# 1-Competition-Template

This project is a competition template.  When you go to competitions, you plug into the field.  This gives the tournament control to enable or disable your robot in driver control or autonomous.  

All of your user control code goes in `void usercontrol(void) {}`, and all of your autonomous code goes in `void autonomous(void) {}`.  

Coding in a competition template is required for tournaments. 

In practice to switch between `user` and `auton`, you can use a competition switch.
